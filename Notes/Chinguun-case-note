Samba has multiple methods of user authentication. Feature is to check user in two level: 
1. User name and password 
2. Access rights to the files and directories. 

Samba can handle individual users, guest users and groups share access by using its flags in configuration file. For example:

path = /home/dave 
comment = Dave's home directory
writable = yes 
valid users = dave
