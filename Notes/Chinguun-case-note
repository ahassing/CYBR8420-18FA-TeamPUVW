Misuse case notion and quality
Use of proper misuse case notation (as discussed in class). Reasoning Quality: Misuse cases reflect reasoning that help derive security requirements.

Threat: Hide or delete content on file server /Privilege escalation/ 

In the company, HR manager and employee both access to employee’s directory on file server which contains their application. HR employee also copy job candidate’s application to same folder. 
Malicious insider who is not authorized to edit this file has granted access and hidden some of competitive candidate’s information intentionally.     

Mitigation: Setting permission 
Prevention: Prohibit guest account

To set permission on users individually or group. Prohibit any guest account. 

Reflection
Assess alignment of security requirements with advertised features. Review OSS project documentation and codebase to support your observations.

Samba has multiple methods of user authentication. Feature is to check user in two level: 
1. User name and password 
2. Access rights to the files and directories. 

Samba can handle individual users, guest users and groups share access by using its flags in configuration file. For example:

path = /home/dave 
comment = Dave's home directory
writable = yes 
valid users = dave

OSS project documentation review
Review OSS project documentation for security-related configuration and installation issues. Summarize your observations.

Samba has enough documentation related configuration and installation that covers authentication and permission.
