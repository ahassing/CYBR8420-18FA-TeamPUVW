Description of the use case scenario:

The SAMBA server is a network file server for a small company including their HR department.
The system is used to store files for office use including search and email capability using links.
The files can be shared with other employees in the company outside of the HR department.
The files can be printed using a network attached printer.
The file directories can be listed and searched.

Misuse cases for listing of files on the SAMBA server:

1. Path or Directory Traversal - this misuse case is when a file path or directory
   is misconfigured or terminates file name access due to an error. This causes the
   HR manager or employees to not be able to list files on the server. One example
   in the code base was when a man in the middle attack allowed read and alter
   access via a client connection when a DFS (file server) redirect when the
   original connection was SMB3.

2. Sensitive file exposure - this misuse case occurs when sensitive files are
   inadvertently exposed to the HR manager or other employees on the server. An
   example would be a document of employees to be terminated or laid off.

3. Corrupted directories or file names - this misuse case occurs when the file
   names or directories contain non-displayed or malformed file names, such as
   binary file names, causing the HR manager not to be able to access the files
   or delete or modify the file names. This was demonstrated as a August 2018
   security error in SAMBA. (https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-10858.html)

Misuse cases for Email Links to Files:

1. Malicious file injection - this misuse case is when a link is shared with
   a malicious file which could potentially be opened by a recipient which
   would then inject malware on the HR manager or employees client computer.
   One example was a bug were a SAMBA server was caused to execute from
   a writable share using a shared library.

2. File Manipulation - this misuse case is when the email link is used to
   alter the contents or the name of a file on a server. This could also be
   used to maliciously copy or duplicate files across servers. One example
   in the code base was a time-of-check, time-of-use race condition which
   allowed clients to access non-exported parts of the file system via
   symbolic links. (https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2017-2619.html)

3. Network evesdropping - this misuse case is when someone uses a file link
   accessed from a network monitor like Wireshark or a email interceptor program
   to steal information from the email or the file server. For example, one
   email could contain a link to a file and other emails could contain a user
   id and password to access the file. See Man-in-the-Middle attack patch
