Description of use case scenario:
This is a system for distributing and managing Human Resource (HR) files for a small-medium sized company.

The system should have the following features:
HR personnel should be able to manage (add/remove/update) files
All non-HR employees should be able to access (read-only) the files
The files should be printable
The files should be able to be listed and searched by all employees
HR personnel should have the ability to email links to files, for example in the even that they are updated this could be used as a mechanism to notify all employees of the change


------
Encrypt files in transit – Yes, SAMBA supports native SSL support along with SSL supported connections to LDAP servers: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html#LDAPSSL

XX User authentication --  Yes, SAMBA provides user authentication natively when running as a standalone server as described here: https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_a_Standalone_Server#Creating_a_Local_User_Account
However, this is not how Samba is typically used, often SAMBA is used along with PAM or LDAP which provide their own user authentication mechanisms.

Log monitoring – No, SAMBA does not support log monitoring natively, although it does have the capability to generate robust logging. https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html#LOGGING

XX Password policy – Yes, SAMBA does provide tools for establishing password policies. The following policies can be set: minimum password length, maximum and maximum password age, storing password history to prevent password reuse, lockout of account after a definable number of failed attempts and duration of account lockout after failed attempts limit reached.
See option --account-policy in https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/pdbedit.8.html

Permission verification – Yes, SAMBA suppors Access Control Lists (ACL) which enable management of user permissions control.  https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_Share_Using_Windows_ACLs



-------------------

CRUD misuse case:
The original users/use cases: We have three classes of users who each have one use case: an HR manager who needs to add and remove files, and HR Employee who needs to update the contents of files, and a regular employee who needs to access (read-only) the files.
The misusers/misuse cases: We have Mr. Malicious who is intent on injecting malicious files to the system, such as a virus. Mr. Manipulator who is interested in manipulating the files in our system, for example to inject incorrect information. Mr. Voyeur who is interested in accessing files on our system without authorization via the mechanisms of network eavesdropping and accessing the system with stolen credentials.

Additional users/use-cases:  In response to the misusers and misuse cases we have added new users and use cases.  We now have a system administrator who is responsible for monitoring logs which can monitor malicious file injection via identification of a new file being added by a new party, or if using stolen credentials possibly the addition of a file outside of business hours.
The system administrator is also responsible for managing user authentication, by that we mean that the system administrator is responsible for management of user accounts that have access to the system.  

We the use case of permission verification for the HR manager, this is the HR Managers responsibility because he/she is the one who would know who should have the privileged access of add/remove files (HR Manager) and update files (HR Employee) everyone else would have read access only.

We add the use case of encrypt files in transit
